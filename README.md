# Welcome to my portfolio

In this repository is my current portfolio, I have studied the basics of python, data science, basic machine learning and data visualization in python along with machine learning via neural networks. I have also studied java, C++ and game design within the Unity game engine. Overall, I am most proficient in python, specifically machine learning and data visualization. 


# File organization

This repository is organized first by language, and then by project, or assignment number. All projects within the same language are organized in a single folder. C++ projects include all necessary cpp files and header files, along with a readme of how to compile every project. The game design in unity folder is organized such that you would need to open the highest level folders with the unity engine, as this allows the highest level analysis of code, level design and game design as a whole. The java files are organized by project as well. The Machine learning files are organized by individual projects and they are formatted as jupyter notebook files with every project having an in depth analysis of of the model structure, dataset used, results and proposed enhancements to the model as well.

## Collaborative work

Two projects within the repository were worked on collaboratively. The first being the matching game in the game design in unity folder and the second being the final (group) project within the machine learning folder. Both have proper attribution of work split and the respective group members.
