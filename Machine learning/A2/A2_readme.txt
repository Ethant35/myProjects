1. HW2.ipynb, HW2 report, HW2readme
2. Everything works correctly, just one thing that happened was that for the apple data I used, the final line of the csv file has a line that says something like "Created by xyz" and the file must be edited by hand to delete that part
because otherwise an error occurs because keras can't convert text to tensors.
3. No outside sources used.
