The loser Dave lived alone and sad. He realized he had way too many onions. They were making him cry and no one loved him, but that was true regardless of the onions.
One day, a delivery person came by to give Dave something. At first, Dave thought this was the start of a beautiful connection.
That was, until Tucker the dog started to bite her leg and steal her soul.
Dave was sad until he picked up the package and shook it.
He opened it and was in awe of what he saw!
The letter caught on fire and so did his house!
But everything was okay, and he was with his girlfriend.
They lived together until they died. RIP.
